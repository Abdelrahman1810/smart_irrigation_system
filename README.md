This project is a smart irrigation system that uses an Arduino microcontroller and moisture sensors to automatically water plants when the soil dries out. The system is designed to save water and reduce overwatering, which can lead to plant disease and waste of resources.

# Features

* Moisture sensors that measure the soil moisture level
* Automatic watering system that turns on when the soil is dry
* Adjustable watering settings for different types of plants
* LCD display for real-time data visualization

# Installation

To install and set up the smart irrigation system, follow these steps:

    1. Clone the repository to your local machine
    2. Install the required libraries for Arduino
    3. Connect the moisture sensors to the Arduino board
    4. Configure the watering settings in the code
    5. Upload the code to the Arduino board
    6. Connect the Arduino board to the water pump and valves
    7. Connect the LCD display to the Arduino board

# Usage

Once the smart irrigation system is installed and set up, you can use it to water your plants automatically. The moisture sensors will detect when the soil is dry and activate the water pump and valves to water the plants. You can adjust the watering settings in the code to suit different types of plants.

The LCD display provides real-time data visualization, so you can see the soil moisture level and watering status of your plants. You can also adjust the watering settings from the code.
